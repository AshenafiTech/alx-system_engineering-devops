# Web Infrastructure Design Project

This project explores different web infrastructure architectures, starting from a simple single-server setup to more advanced distributed, secure, monitored, and scalable environments. Each design is documented in its own file for clarity and comparison.

- `0-simple_web_stack.md`: Single server with LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- `1-distributed_web_infrastructure.md`: Multi-server, load-balanced, and database-replicated architecture
- `2-secured_monitored_web_infrastructure.md`: Security-hardened and monitored web infrastructure (firewalls, HTTPS, monitoring, alerting)
- `3-scaled_up_web_infrastructure.md`: Highly scalable infrastructure with advanced scaling strategies (auto-scaling, distributed databases, etc.)

The goal is to understand the evolution of web infrastructure, the trade-offs of each approach, and best practices for building scalable, reliable, and secure web applications.
