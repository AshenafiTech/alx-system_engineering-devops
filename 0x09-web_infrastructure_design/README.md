# Simple Web Infrastructure: Single Server with LAMP Stack

This document outlines a basic web infrastructure using a single server running a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

## Overview
A LAMP stack is a popular open-source solution for hosting dynamic websites and web applications. In this setup, all components run on a single server, making it suitable for small-scale projects, prototypes, or learning environments.

## Components
- **Server:** A physical or virtual machine, hosted on-premises or in the cloud, running all infrastructure components.
- **Domain Name:** `www.foobar.com` is a human-readable address mapped to the server’s IP (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) via a DNS A record.
- **Subdomain:** The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is a subdomain, typically pointing to the main web server.
- **Web Server (Apache):** Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
- **Application Server (PHP):** Processes business logic, handles user input, and generates dynamic content.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores, retrieves, updates, and deletes application data in a structured format.

## How It Works
1. **User Request:** The user enters `www.foobar.com` in their browser. DNS resolves this to the server’s IP address.
2. **Web Server:** Apache receives the request, serving static files or passing dynamic requests to PHP.
3. **Application Logic:** PHP processes the request, interacts with the database if needed, and generates a response.
4. **Database Operations:** MySQL manages the application’s data, supporting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
5. **Response:** The server returns the response to the user’s browser over HTTP or HTTPS.

## Protocols
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Communication between the server and clients uses HTTP or HTTPS, with HTTPS providing encrypted, secure data transfer.

## Limitations of This Architecture
While simple and cost-effective, this infrastructure has several drawbacks:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
- **Maintenance Downtime:** Updates or deployments require restarting services, causing downtime.
- **Limited Scalability:** The server can only handle a limited amount of traffic; high loads may cause slowdowns or outages.
- **Security Risks:** All services run on one machine, increasing the impact of a security breach.

## Recommendations
This setup is ideal for small projects, testing, or educational purposes. For production or high-availability environments, consider:
- Using multiple servers for redundancy
- Implementing load balancers
- Separating application and database servers
- Adding security layers (firewalls, monitoring, backups)
