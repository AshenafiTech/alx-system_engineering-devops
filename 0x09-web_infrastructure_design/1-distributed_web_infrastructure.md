# Distributed Web Infrastructure: Multi-Server Architecture

This document describes a distributed web infrastructure designed for high availability, scalability, and improved fault tolerance compared to a single-server setup.

## Overview
A distributed web infrastructure uses multiple servers and components to handle increased traffic, avoid single points of failure, and provide better performance and reliability. This architecture is suitable for production environments and applications requiring high uptime.

## Components
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers using a specified distribution algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections). Enables active-active setups, where all servers handle requests simultaneously, as opposed to active-passive, where standby servers only take over if a primary fails.
- **Web Servers:** Multiple servers serve static and dynamic content, reducing load on any single server and providing redundancy.
- **Application Servers:** Handle business logic and dynamic content generation. Can be scaled horizontally as needed.
- **Database Cluster (Primary-Replica):** Implements a primary-replica (master-slave) configuration. The primary node handles write operations, while replica nodes handle read operations and provide redundancy. If the primary fails, a replica can be promoted to primary.
- **Shared Storage/Cache (Optional):** Used for session management or storing static assets accessible by all servers.

## How It Works
1. **User Request:** The user accesses the application via the load balancer.
2. **Load Balancing:** The load balancer forwards the request to one of the available web servers based on the configured algorithm.
3. **Web/Application Processing:** The selected web/application server processes the request, interacting with the database cluster as needed.
4. **Database Operations:** The primary database node handles writes; replicas handle reads. Replication ensures data consistency and availability.
5. **Response:** The server returns the response to the user through the load balancer.

## Key Concepts
- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:** In active-active, all servers are live and share the load. In active-passive, only one server is active at a time; others are on standby.
- **Primary vs. Replica Database Nodes:** The primary node manages all data modifications. Replica nodes synchronize with the primary and handle read requests, improving performance and redundancy.

## Advantages
- **Redundancy:** No single point of failure; if one server fails, others continue to serve traffic.
- **Scalability:** Easily add more servers to handle increased load.
- **Improved Performance:** Load is distributed, reducing bottlenecks.

## Limitations & Considerations
- **Complexity:** More components require careful configuration and management.
- **Potential SPOF:** The load balancer or primary database can still be a single point of failure if not made redundant.
- **Security & Monitoring:** This setup does not yet include firewalls, HTTPS, or monitoring tools. These should be added for a production-ready system.

*For even greater reliability and security, consider adding firewalls, enabling HTTPS, and implementing monitoring and alerting systems.*
